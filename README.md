## Creating a portable Visualization-Application for Camera-Tracking-Information

### Abstract
Tracking- and Calibration-Procedures in AR require a large information set given in form of Spatial-Relationship-Graphs.
Ever so often it is required to visualize these given data-sets between a tracking-system and it's sensor in a simpler, easier to comprehend, fashion.
In order to achieve this, this project will focus on creating a 3D-Cross-Platform-Visualization-Tool using LibGDX.
It will transform given tracking measurements into detailled 3D-graphs of the given translation/rotation between tracker and marker.
A side goal will be to dynamically generate SRGs from these tracking-sets and derive missing edges from given information.
